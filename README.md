# WHO_Life_Expectancy_prediction
We will be using Multivariate Linear Regression models for Life Expectancy Prediction

In This Notebook we will explore the WHO life Expectancy dataset provided by Kaggle. We will start by exploring the data and make a prediction model to predict the life expectancy of a person given certain attribute.
We will use Linear Regression Algorithm to create our prediction model. Linear Regression is the first and very important algorithm to model the linear relationship of two or more variables.
We will built a multiple linear regression model and see how to manually and automatically select statistically significant variable for multivariate linear regresiion model.
We will also check the Assumption of Linear regression models and evaluation metrics of our model.
